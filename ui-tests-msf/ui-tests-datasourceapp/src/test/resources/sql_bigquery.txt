-- INFO: You can convert an attribute to:
-- a connection point by renaming the column from a__<column_name> to cp__<column_name>
-- a reference by renaming the column from a__<column_name> to r__<table_name>


--- INFO
--- We use the DECIMAL (12, 2) data type.
--- Verify that your facts (f__) can be converted to this data type.
--- If you need a greater precision and/or scale, manually increase the data size in the generated DDL before executing it and/or update the logical data model.
--- Maximum precision/scale support is DECIMAL(15,6), if you even need a greater precision and/or scale, contact GoodData Support.
